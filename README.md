- 👋 Hi I’m @100-dev, Formally 99. 100 represents my approach to tech and web technologies. My first project will be to recreate my website from scratch, using the languages Html, CSS & Javascript.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new languages such as Ruby/Ruby on rails. Python and newer languages like GO and Swift.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some advanced techniques in javascript to aid building my website in a more content friendly way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are in need of design expertise. As a UX designer by trade it makes sense to know how to code, so I can semantically discuss both design and coding practices.
- 📫 For collaboration or questions about my work, contact me through git-hub. We can arrange a call.
